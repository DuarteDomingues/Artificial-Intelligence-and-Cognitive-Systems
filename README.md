# Artificial-Intelligence-and-Cognitive-Systems

Final project of the course IASC (Inteligência Artificial para Sistemas Coginitivos)

Engenharia Informática e Multimédia - ISEL

---
In this project different models and algorithms of artificial intelligence and 
and cognitive systems were developed. 

The project was divided into the following stages:
* Realization of a prototype based on a neural network platform for solving 
problems and the application of neural networks to an image classification problem.
* Realization of a reinforcement learning system, with different learning methods. 
* Realization of an automatic reasoning system for planning with different methods 
and optimization algorithms.
