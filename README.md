# Artificial-Intelligence-and-Cognitive-Systems

### Final project of the subject IASC (Inteligência Artificial para Sistemas Coginitivos)

Mestrado Engenharia Informática e Multimédia - ISEL

---
In this project different models and algorithms of artificial intelligence and 
and cognitive systems were developed. 

The project was divided into the following stages:
* Realization of a prototype based on a neural network platform for solving 
problems and the application of neural networks to an image classification problem.
* Realization of a reinforcement learning system, with different learning methods. 
* Realization of an automatic reasoning system for planning with different methods 
and optimization algorithms.

### Folder Organization:

* The folder 01_neural_networks contains the neural network problems solved in the project.
* The folder 02_reinforcement_learning contains the developed reinforcement learning system.
* The folder 03_state_space_search_and_otimization contains the developed state space search and optimization systems.
* The folder relatorio contains the final project paper.
